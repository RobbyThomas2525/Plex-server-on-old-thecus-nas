# Plex-server-on-old-thecus-nas
how i got plex server to run on my 2010 NAS everything should work as long as it's 
TheCus OS 32bit so these devices '1U4200XXX, 1U4600, N2200XXX, N3200XXX, N4100PRO, N4200, N4200Eco, N4200PRO, N5200XXX, N5500, N7700, N7700+, N7700PRO, N7700SAS, N8200XXX, N8800, N8800+, N8800PRO, N8800SAS.

(Note for Plex) I am not associated in plex in any way also forget about plex supporting this it's from 2013 and there might be a security risk using this old of a version but anyways

if not the guild will still work if you have TheCus OS 5 64 bit and 6 7 32 and 64 bit you just need to get it from archive.org instead of me here's the URL where i got it from
