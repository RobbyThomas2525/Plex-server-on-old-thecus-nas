# Plex-server-on-old-thecus-nas
how i got plex server to run on my 2010 NAS everything should work as long as it's 
TheCus OS 32bit so these devices '1U4200XXX, 1U4600, N2200XXX, N3200XXX, N4100PRO, N4200, N4200Eco, N4200PRO, N5200XXX, N5500, N7700, N7700+, N7700PRO, N7700SAS, N8200XXX, N8800, N8800+, N8800PRO, N8800SAS. if not the guild should still work if you have TheCus OS 5 64 bit and 6 7 32 and 64 bit you just need to get it from archive.org instead of me here's the URL where i got it from
https://web.archive.org/web/20150423124637/http://www.thecus.com/sp_app_center.php

(Note for Plex) I am not associated in plex in any way also forget about plex supporting this it's from 2013 and there might be a security risk using this old of a version but anyways)

Step 1 download the .mod i have here or from my archive.org https://archive.org/details/Plex_0.9.7.28.33_x86_ForTheCusNAS if you need one for TheCus OS 5 64 bit and 6 7 32 and 64 bit i got my files from here https://web.archive.org/web/20150423124637/http://www.thecus.com/sp_app_center.php

step 2 go to module installion part on the NAS take the .mod files including ffmpeg and modcase and click the computer box with the + icon and select the files and click install and let it install after that enable the all the modules with either the small square or the the play button under the action section

step 3 after that you should be able to launch plex though (yourip):32400/ or though the module page it will have a setup page like this i don't think you need a plex account

step 4 is ripping your media you can use makemkv i just use handbreak cause the linux version comes with software needed to break the DVD encryption i'm using these settings the RF you might have to change depending on the movie also i use H264 cause H265 and AV1 i'm sure is out of the question on these NAS and i'm only doing DVDs there's other videos online about it if you use someone elses video just make sure you use MKV as the format
